# Soil Moisture

Demonstrations (from download to visualization) of surface soil moisture (SSM), root-zone soil moisture (RZSM)  products can be found in the soil moisture cluster folder. To run the jupyter notebook exercises, you will first need to install the relevant python libraries, which can be done by running the miniconda scripts provided. The miniconda scripts will install the libraries on a local environment on either linux or MacOS systems. Note that recent operating systems are required.

Access to the H SAF ftp is also important in order to download the products (new users can register here for a username and password https://hsaf.meteoam.it/User/Register)
