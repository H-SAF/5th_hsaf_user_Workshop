# 5th H SAF User Workshop

The 5th H SAF User Workshop supported by [EUMeTrain](http://eumetrain.org/) will be held in online in January 24-28 2022. This repository contains instructions, code examples and links to data sets used on the demonstration session of the workshop (Friday, 28th January 2022).

All H SAF products can be ordered and downloaded after a [user registration](https://hsaf.meteoam.it/User/Register) at the [H SAF website](http://h-saf.eumetsat.int). You will receive a username and password to access the H SAF FTP. 
The data required for the exercises are available at the [Demonstration session Dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kevyc8n2gcmml1h/AADhIMceX9eCGFF5JmCvKfria?dl=0).
Additionally are available  [presentations pre-recordings](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yu7he29easvvyar/AABr7b2s7QcXNivs-1t9fniOa?dl=0) from Demonstration session.

# Precipitation

# Soil Moisture

The demonstration gives an overview how to download, read and visualize H SAF soil moisture data using the Python programming language. Jupyter notebooks are used to present code examples. H SAF Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) and Root-Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM) products are comprised of either Near Real-Time (NRT), Offline or Data Records (DR) products, which are freely available after user registration at the H SAF data portal. RZSM products are generated from assimilating the ASCAT-derived surface SM in the ECMWF/H SAF land data assimilation system. Additionally, a hydrological exercise will highlight the added value of soil moisture satellite data for flood prediction. Soil moisture conditions have a great impact on the transformation of precipitation into runoff. A correct estimation of the initial soil moisture condition is a critical aspect for operational flood prediction. In the exercise we will test the sensitivity of flood response to initial soil moisture conditions using a simple hydrological model over an African Basin.
